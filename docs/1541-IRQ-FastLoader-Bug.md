# 1541 IRQ / FastLoader Bug — motm `LOAD"*",8,1`

Status: open, 2026-05-07. **Updated 2026-05-07 with Spec 217 trace-store
diff evidence** — see new "Diff evidence" section below for the
hard ceiling of 4096 bytes received in headless before stall.

## Symptom

motm `LOAD"*",8,1` hangs forever after KERNAL hand-off into custom
fastloader. Screen stays grey, drive stuck on track 17, c64 looping
in fastloader DATA-wait, drive looping in RAM bit-bang RX wait.

In VICE (baseline): same fastloader runs through, game boots.

## Stuck state (after warmup ≈ 35s)

Captured over a 5s observation window (34 samples @ 50k c64-cyc):

| field | value | note |
|---|---|---|
| `c64Pc` | `$43C7-$43CD` (4 PCs) | DATA-wait loop in motm fastloader stage-2 |
| `drvPc` | `$07BE-$07C8` (5 PCs) | drive RAM bit-bang RX wait |
| `track` | `17` stable | correct track for stage-2 |
| motor | `true` | drive motor running |
| `bitOffset` | 3256 → 39688 (Δ 36432) | head rotates, GCR clocks bytes |
| `syncActive` | `false` | shifter never sees SYNC marker |
| `dataByte` | varying ($e9 → $ba) | byte latch updates (rotation alive) |
| `density` | `3` | correct for track 17 |
| `$DD00` | `$43` frozen | bit 7 = 0 → DATA-in stays asserted |
| drive VIA1 PB | `$03` frozen | drive does not toggle IEC outputs |
| IEC `cpu_bus` | `$d0` frozen | c64 IEC out stable |
| IEC `cpu_port` | `$40` frozen | |
| IEC `drv_port` | `$84` frozen | |
| IEC `drv_data[8]` | `$18` frozen | |

Both sides loop in their own tight wait loops. Neither side toggles
any IEC / VIA line. **Handshake wedge.**

## c64 stuck loop (`02_ab_disasm.asm`, fastloader load addr `$4000`)

```
W43BE:
      dec  $031C
      beq  W43BA            ; jmp $44B4 (exit caller)
      ldx  #$07
      ldy  #$30             ; 48-iter timeout counter
W43C7:
      dey
      beq  W43BA            ; timeout exit
      bit  $DD00            ; sets N from bit7 (= DATA-IN)
      bpl  W43C7            ; loop while bit7 = 0
W43CF:
      lda  $DD00            ; ...read byte bit, eor / shift, etc.
      ...
```

Loop exits when bit 7 of `$DD00` = 1, i.e. drive releases DATA-line.

Re-entered from `wait_loader_completion` at `$4370` via `jsr $43BE`,
so the timeout-exit path just re-enters next outer iteration.

## VICE comparison (1199 chunks, 50k-instr each)

VICE c64 PC histogram — top:

| PC | samples | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `$4240` ($423D-$424F area) | 873 (73%) | raster-sync delay (`lda $D012; cmp #$C8`) |
| `$43C7-$43CD` | 173 (14%) | **same DATA-wait loop** |

VICE *does* enter the same `$43C7` wait loop, dd00=`$43`, drvPb=`$03`,
drvPc in `$07BE-$07C8` — **exactly our stuck state**. Difference:
VICE escapes after 2-5 consecutive chunks (≤5 × 50k instr ≈ 250k cyc);
ours never escapes.

VICE drive PC histogram is broad — drive code visits `$0372`, `$03B3`,
`$0412`, `$0714`, `$07C1`, plus ROM idle `$F560`. Our drive PC stays
strictly inside `$07BE-$07C8`.

VICE-level raster-sync `$4240` accounts for 73% of c64 time. We see
0% there in the stuck window — c64 never makes it back to the
raster-sync stage of the fastloader.

## Hypotheses (after VICE c64-history + drive-history diff, 2026-05-07)

**Original H1/H2 (deadlock) is wrong.** Both VICE and our headless show
drive-side periodic ROM excursions (`$F55D`, `$F560`, `$F565`, `$F2C7`,
`$F43A`, `$F82D`, `$F7F3`, `$F887`) interleaved with active bit-bang
RX in `$0714-$0732` plus wait-loop in `$07BE-$07C8`. drvPb on both
sides cycles `$03 → $0c → $00 → $0d → $0f` during active RX, and our
stuck-trace catches escape moments (12/34 = 35% of samples are NOT
in the stuck-wait state).

VICE **does** spend long stretches at `$43C7` too — e.g. chunks 880,
900, 920 (≈3M c64-cyc, ≈12500 outer wait iterations) before escape
to `$43CF` byte-receive. The wait loop is **expected and normal** in
this fastloader.

| H | claim | how to falsify |
|---|---|---|
| H1' | bit-bang receives bits but at wrong cadence — bytes-per-second too low → load times out / state machine stalls before EOF | count bytes received per sec in VICE vs our headless during active RX |
| H2' | bit values shifted wrong — wrong sequence reaches `$031B` accumulator, fastloader receives garbage and `cmp #$FF / cmp #$FC / cmp #$05` decisions go wrong path | dump `$031B` accumulator + write history at `$98/$99` (RX dest pointer) over time |
| H3' | drive RAM RX state machine completes a chunk but never receives the LAST chunk's "done" signal → wait_loader_completion at `$4370` loops forever on `$031A` | watch `$031A` and `$031D` flags both sides |
| H4' | drive ROM IRQ cadence (VIA1/VIA2 timer underflow) differs between VICE and us → drive vectors to ROM at wrong moments → bit-bang clock skew | compare drive cyc per ROM-excursion in VICE vs us |

**Most likely:** **H4'** (drive timer-IRQ cadence) → cascades to bit
skew → wrong bytes → load never completes. This matches Spec 203
(IRQ timestamping) and Specs 210/211 (CIA/VIA fidelity) being still
open.

## Evidence — VICE c64-history chunks 880-960 (escape sequence)

Chunks (cpuhistory bursts of 32 instructions each):

- 880, ts=44M, c64-clk 32.6M: 32 consecutive instr at `$43C7-$43CD`,
  Y decrementing $16→$0F (timeout countdown).
- 900, ts=45M, c64-clk 33.0M: same loop, Y=$20→$18.
- 920, ts=46M, c64-clk 33.4M: same loop, Y=$29→$22.
- **940, ts=47M, c64-clk 33.8M: c64 escaped to `$43E1` byte-rx (X=$01 — already 6 bits in).**
  Sequence: `sta $DD00` ($43E1) → `jsr $43BD` (rts) → `nop nop` →
  `asl $9A; asl $9A` → `rol $031B` → `dex; bpl $43CF`.
- 960, ts=48M: still in bit-rx loop `$43CF-$43E9`.

Between c64-clk 33.4M (chunk 920) and 33.8M (chunk 940) ≈ 393K c64-cyc,
drive emitted enough bits to advance c64 8 RX iterations.

Our headless stuck-trace shows the SAME pattern at ts=34985723:
c64 at `$43E1`, drive at `$0723`, dd00=`$23`, drvPb=`$0d`. So the
mechanism works — but throughput / correctness fails downstream.

## Architectural note

This is the same class of bug we hit on 2026-05-04 with the first
fastloader attempt. Sprint 112 / Specs 201-202 moved IEC catch-up to
the `KernelBus` and made `true-drive` event-driven, which is what
makes byte-perfect KERNAL `LOAD` work today. But the kernel boundary
only catches up **on c64 access of `$DD00`**. When the drive runs
free between c64 `$DD00` accesses and is supposed to fire an IRQ on
its own VIA1 from an IEC edge, the edge has to be observed by the
drive without c64 polling the bus.

If H1 holds, the fix is in the drive-side IEC edge → VIA1 IRQ
delivery, not in `KernelBus` catch-up.

## Diff evidence — VICE vs headless trace-store (2026-05-07)

Captured both sides into Spec 217 trace store, ran
`scripts/trace-store-diff.mjs` with tolerance ±1024 master-clocks.
Headless ran 60s emulated; VICE ran to game_handoff (~153s).

| anchor | VICE | headless | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `ab_entry` ($4000) | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| `bitbang_tx_24bit` ($425C) | 250 | 3 | **-98.8%** |
| `bitbang_tx_inner` ($4294) | 6000 | 72 | -98.8% |
| `drive_rom_idle` ($F55D/$F560) | 2.08M | 619K | -70% |
| `drive_rx_active` ($0714) | 531K | **4096** | **-99.2%** |
| `drive_rx_wait` ($07BE) | 1.31M | 1.68M | **+28.4%** |
| **`rx_byte`** ($43CF) | **523K** | **4096** | **-99.2%** |
| `rx_wait` ($43C7) | 3.97M | 2.39M | -39.9% |
| `wait_loader_completion` ($4370) | 5 | 1 | -80% |
| **`game_handoff`** ($F500) | **1** | **0** | **-100%** |

### Cadence: rx_byte ($43CF) per 1M master-clocks

VICE: sustained across Mc-windows 50–107 (~57s of fastloader streaming
to game_handoff at Mc 150.6M).

Headless: only Mc 34–35 (~1s burst, ~4096 bytes), then complete stall.
After Mc 35 c64 keeps spinning `$43C7` wait-loop (rx_wait still
accumulates 2.39M total) but rx_byte ($43CF, the byte-receive entry)
gets reached 0 more times.

### Refined diagnosis

The 2026-05-06 hypothesis space narrows:

- **H1 (deadlock) — REJECTED.** Headless drive does run RAM custom
  code + ROM excursions. drvPb does cycle. drv_rom_idle accumulates
  619K hits (vs VICE 2.08M); drive_rx_wait actually exceeds VICE
  count (+28%), so drive is busy waiting for c64-side handshake.
- **H1' (bit-throughput) — CONFIRMED as primary.** Headless rx_byte
  caps at exactly **4096 bytes** then stalls. VICE keeps going to
  523K. So the failure is bounded — something hits a 4096-byte
  ceiling.
- **H2' (bit-values wrong) — possible but not proven.** A wrong-bit
  could cause drive's RX state machine to mis-interpret a chunk
  boundary; symptom would be exactly this kind of N-byte cap.

### Strong lead — the 4096 ceiling

`drive_rx_active` and `rx_byte` both = 4096. That's `2^12`. Specific
counter / sector-buffer / packet size? Possible candidates:

- `$031C` is decremented by `$43BE` and gates the wait-loop entry
  (initial value `$30` = 48). 48 × ~85 byte chunks = ~4080 bytes.
- A 4-block sector counter overflowing wrong-side.
- Drive-side RAM `$98/$99` destination pointer wrapping at a
  boundary that VICE handles but we don't.

Next probe: pull instruction-level trace from headless trace-store
for the last ~20K instructions of master_clock window 34-36 and
follow what the c64 + drive do at the stall point.

## Next step (when resuming)

Phase 1 — read-only diff against VICE (no code):

1. Find a VICE c64-history chunk where c64 transitions OUT of `$43C7`
   loop into `$43CF` (escape).
2. Read the surrounding 10-20 instructions (c64 + drive at same clock).
3. Identify the exact register / IRQ event that triggered escape.
4. Verify that event does not occur in our stuck-trace.

Phase 2 — only if Phase 1 inconclusive: enable Spec 205-A `cpu`
channel JSONL on our side, capture same window per-instruction,
side-by-side diff via Spec 205-B CLI.
